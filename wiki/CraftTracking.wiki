#summary Entity tracking algorithm

This stuff is work-in-progress. I'd like to make it more generic and define it functionally, perhaps with an implementation in Scala.

A design for a Entity Tracking Engine (ETE).

==Assumptions and Definitions==

  # A *craft* is an entity with position that may change with time. Examples are vessels, aircraft, vehicles, gps units.
  # A craft has at least one *identifier* which uniquely identifies the craft at any one instant.
  # A *fix* has time, latitude, longitude,a set of identifiers, and ancillary data
  # The *source* is the originating agent of a fix.
  # Identifiers are ranked in terms of their reliability. The MMSI number of a vessel changes over time (e.g on change of ownership the owner may reregister the vessel) so it is considered <b>weaker</b> than IMO Number which does not change over time. In this case the <i>rank</i> of IMO Number would be have a <b>higher</b> rank  than the rank of MMSI number. 
  # The *primary identifier* for a craft or a fix is the highest ranked identifier. If more than one identifier of the highest rank for the craft exist then an arbitrary deterministic choice is made (such as using the alphabetical order of the identifier name).
  # A *secondary identifier* for a craft or a fix is an identifier other than the _primary identifier_
  # A list of *ordered identifiers* is a list of identifiers ordered by descending rank then alphabetical identifier name.
  # Craft _A_ is considered *stronger* than Craft _B_ if the <i>primary identifier</i> for craft _A_ is stronger than the <i>primary identifier</i> for craft _B_
  # The *matching identifier* for a fix is the first (in descending rank) identifier that matches a craft
  # The *primary craft* for a fix is the craft which has the _primary identifier_ of the fix.
  # The *craft type* is the category of the craft.
  
==Principles==
  # An identifier is associated with one and only one craft at any one time.
  # If the _primary craft_ does not exist for a fix then create a craft with the _primary identifier_ and associate the fix to that craft.
  # A secondary fix identifier matching another craft will <i>migrate</i> to the primary craft if the primary craft is <i>stronger</i> than the other craft.
  # If a migrating fix identifier is the primary identifier of another craft then the two craft are merged into the primary craft provided that
    * The nominated maximum speed for the fix craft type does not exist OR
      # the calculated average speed to move from the latest existing primary craft fix to the current fix position is less than a nominated maximum (where specified) for the craft type (e.g. 50 knots for a vessel).
      # the time difference between the two fixes is &gt;= N seconds (for all craft types). N should be configurable. N=60s seems reasonable.
  # If the merge condition is not satisfied then discard identifiers from the fix that relate to the primary craft and associate the fix with the secondary craft. 
  # if a fix already exists in terms of craft type, craft reporting agent (source), latitude, longitude and time and identity (only one common identifier needed) then it is ignored. 

C = set of craft
id: C ->

{{{
if fix exists already then
  exit
find the primary craft from the fix identifiers

                    //merge
                    move all identifiers and craft associations from the other craft to the primary craft.
                      if there is a conflict on an identifier type then the identifier is retained on
                      the primary craft and removed from the other craft
                    delete the other craft

            update primary craft with fix identifier value

            add the new craft identity from the fix identifier to the primary craft
